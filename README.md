pretzelday
==========

As a joke, I was challenged to post a count down, every day, for a year to a date in January. I was watching an episode of the Office where Stanley becomes upset that there is 365 more days till the next pretzel day. My friends do not know that I wrote this script, but whoever finds will. At the time, my skills were limited so my work around to posting to Facebook was to use IFTTT to receive an email and post the subject to Facebook. 

I have been looking to get this to post to Facebook directly but I haven't been successful, novice I guess! If you do know an easy way, let me know!

###Installation and Execution:
	bundle install
	
	# Then run the program!
	ruby facebook.rb
